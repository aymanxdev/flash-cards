# Flashcards Program 📝 

## Are flashcards effective way to learn a new language? 📚
A digital flashcard system can optimize the scheduling of each card so you learn with “maximum efficiency” 


## How does this program work? 
In this example it reads from a csv file the column which has French words, then display the word for 3 seconds before reading the corresponding English word and display it in a different card. The user then has the option to confim it as known or unknown. All the yet-to-learn words are saved in a separate file to again to start where the user left off.

To start using this program clone this repo to your local machine or run it on repl.com
